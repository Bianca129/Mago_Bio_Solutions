# Project Description: Development of Cloud-Based Backend Solution and Integration with User-Friendly Frontend Mobile Application for Mago


## Overview
This project contains the development of a cloud-based backend solution and integration with a user-friendly frontend mobile application for Mago Bio Solutions. The frontend of the mobile application was developed by me, providing users with an intuitive interface for visualizing and managing eComposter data.
We designed the app ourselves. 

### Backend Solution: 

The cloud-based backend solution was developed to facilitate automated communication and data transfer between Mago's eComposter machines and their central database. The solution also includes administration functions for managing eComposter machines and user accounts, including creating new eComposters, creating user accounts, and assigning users to eComposter machines.


### Frontend Mobile Application:
The frontend of the mobile application was developed to provide users with an intuitive interface for visualizing and managing eComposter data. It enables users to manually adjust machine settings, access real-time status and performance data of the machines, and review historical data through diagrams generated from past data points. The application utilizes color coding and logs to indicate any problems or anomalies, facilitating quick identification and resolution of issues. Moreover, users have the capability to contact Mago directly through the application for further assistance or support. The user experience is further enhanced through a user-friendly dashboard that allows administrators to efficiently manage eComposter machines and user accounts. Notifications are not included in the current functionality of the application.

### Purpose and Objective:
The objective of this project is to optimize the operational processes of Mago Bio Solutions and provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface for visualizing and managing eComposter data. The integration of backend and frontend components enables seamless data transfer and efficient management of the eComposter infrastructure.

### Conclusion:

The successful development of the frontend of the mobile application contributes to advancing Mago Bio Solutions' vision of efficient and sustainable waste processing. By integrating the frontend with the cloud-based backend solution, the application provides a comprehensive solution for visualizing, managing, and administering eComposter data.
